Task Description: Interactive Quiz Application
1.Editor / Development Environment Used :

The Interactive Quiz Application was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet powerful source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports multiple programming languages and provides useful features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion (IntelliSense), error detection, live server extensions, and easy project file management. These features helped in efficiently writing, organizing, and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code during the development of the quiz application. The project files were organized into separate folders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to maintain a clean and modular structure.

2.About the Task:

The task involves designing and developing a fully functional Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this task is to apply front-end web development concepts to build a dynamic, user-friendly quiz system that allows users to test their knowledge across different categories.

The application is entirely client-side and does not require any backend or database. All quiz questions are stored locally in a JavaScript file, and the quiz logic is handled dynamically using JavaScript functions and event handling.

3.Objectives of the Task:

The key objectives of this task are:

To understand the structure and role of HTML in building web pages.

To apply CSS for styling, layout, and responsive design.

To use JavaScript for implementing dynamic behavior and logic.

To handle user interactions such as button clicks and option selections.

To manage timers, score calculation, and result display.

To create a real-world mini project using core web technologies.

4.Description of the Quiz Application:

The quiz application begins with a Quiz Configuration Screen, where the user selects:

Quiz Category (Programming, General Knowledge, Web Development, Science & Technology)

Number of Questions (5, 10, 15, 20, or 25)

These options allow the quiz to be dynamic, meaning the content and behavior of the quiz change based on user input. Once the user clicks the Start Quiz button, the configuration screen is hidden and the quiz screen is displayed.

5.Quiz Functionality:

During the quiz:

Each question is displayed one at a time.

Four multiple-choice options are shown for each question.

A timer of 15 seconds is provided for every question.

If the user selects an answer, the application immediately evaluates it.

Correct answers are highlighted in green, and incorrect answers are highlighted in red.

If the user does not answer within the given time, the correct answer is automatically highlighted.

The “Next” button appears after answering or when time runs out.

The quiz uses random question selection while ensuring that no question is repeated. This is achieved by storing the indexes of previously asked questions and filtering them out during selection.

6.Score Calculation and Result Display:

The application tracks the number of correct answers throughout the quiz. Once all selected questions are answered, the quiz screen is hidden and a Result Screen is displayed. The result screen shows:

Total number of questions

Number of correct answers

A feedback message encouraging the user

The user is also provided with a “Try Again” button, which resets the quiz and brings the user back to the configuration screen.

7.Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the quiz layout, buttons, containers, and content.

CSS: Used for styling the application, including layout, colors, fonts, hover effects, animations, and responsive design.

JavaScript: Used to implement quiz logic, timer functionality, dynamic question rendering, score calculation, and user interaction handling.

8.Conclusion:

This task successfully demonstrates the use of front-end web development concepts to create a dynamic and interactive quiz application. It helps in understanding how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to 

build real-world applications. The project improves logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and practical knowledge of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation. Overall, the Interactive Quiz Application 

serves as an excellent mini project for learning and applying core web development skills.
